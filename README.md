My journey in crossbow shooting began at the age of 19, while studying at Aurora Degree College. With a deep passion for the sport, I quickly advanced through various competitions, each bringing new experiences and successes.

In April 2023, I participated in the District Crossbow Shooting Championship at Dr. B.R. Ambedkar College, competing in the under-22 category and winning a silver medal. This accomplishment encouraged me to pursue the sport further, and soon after, I proudly represented Rangareddy district at the State Crossbow Shooting Championship at GCPE College Grounds. From April 25 to April 30, 2023, I competed once again in the under-22 category and secured a bronze medal, solidifying my presence in the sport.

My journey then took me to the national level in July 2023, where I represented Telangana in the National Crossbow Shooting Championship at Parade Grounds, Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Competing in the under-23 category from July 6 to 9, I gave my best performance and won the gold medal, a major milestone in my career.

The highlight of my journey came with the opportunity to represent India in the International Crossbow Shooting Championship-2023, held in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, from October 26 to October 31. Competing against top athletes from around the world, I earned a remarkable 6th place overall and achieved a world ranking of 8th in the freestyle category. This recognition on the global stage has fueled my motivation to excel further.


My journey has been about relentlessly chasing my goals and gaining expertise across various fields, including programming in Java and C++, as well as web development with Node.js, JavaScript, and React. 

Alongside my technical expertise, I have a strong passion for video editing and 3D animation. Using tools like Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, and Blender, I craft compelling visuals, animations, and stunning effects. Whether it's editing videos, crafting motion graphics, or producing high-quality 3D animations, I enjoy using these creative tools to bring my ideas to life.
